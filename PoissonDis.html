      Named after a French mathematician Simeon Poisson, this discrete
      probability model is similar to the exponential distribution. You are
      modeling the likelyhood of an event happening in a specific time interval.
      The symbol k is used to represent the number of times the event happens
      in the given time frame. The poisson distribution is very good to use
      when you know the average number of times the event should happen in
      a given time frame.
