We have the required elements for the website as a whole on each individual page, and we figured out how to add a YouTube video into a page
html, see the last link on the index page. Also, you may notice the table on the Normal Distribution page is enormous, that wasn't
from one of us spending an hour straight typing "td some number /td," it was written by taking a long list into python and writing html
to a file which we put on the page.
