The minimum of the assignment is obviously present, but the presence of each desired html element, i.e. a table, an image, a link, and a list,
on each page seems to be above the assignment definiton. Also, you may notice the table on the Normal Distribution page is enormous, that wasn't
from one of us spending an hour straight typing "td some number /td," it was written by taking a long list into python and writing html
to a file which we put on the page.
